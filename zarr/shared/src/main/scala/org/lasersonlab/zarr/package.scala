/**
 * Spec / Format questions:
 *
 * Is a .zgroup entry really needed in every "directory" above an array? Doesn't that conflict with treating the paths
 * as â‰ˆopaque blobs and not requiring filesystem-semantics in a backing store?
 *
 * Is "" an allowed fill_value for a fixed-length string datatype, e.g. "|S12"? See question in
 * [[org.lasersonlab.zarr.FillValue.FillValueDecoder.string]]'s docs
 *
 * When is `fill_value` used? Are there sparseness facilities baked in to Zarr? Aren't chunks read in always of size
 * ${datatype.size} * $num_records?
